# website-berners-lee
A page on Tim Berners-Lee
According to a predefined outline, create a web page in honor of Tim.

My first project was a failure. Improper use of GRID. (2h30 on campus). Deleted.

Second project without GRID makes a view acceptable but fixed template (not responsive). (4h30 on campus). Published then Deleted.

Third project finalized in GRID (again), clean code as much as I can. The result satisfies me, finally. Links, colors and visuals are better.
(2h45 at home). Posted.
