A page on Tim Berners-Lee
According to a predefined outline, create a web page in honor of Tim.

My first project was a failure. Improper use of GRID. (2h30 on campus). Deleted.
Second project without GRID makes a siuel acceptable but fixed template. (4h30 on campus). Published then Deleted.
Third project finalized in GRID (again), own code. The result satisfies me, finally. Links, colors and improved rendering.
(2h45 at home). Posted.
